![Website Banner](link-to-your-banner-image.jpg)

Welcome to the Construction Website project! As a professional Next.js developer, I aim to build a stunning website for the construction industry that not only showcases your projects but also provides an intuitive admin dashboard for content and order management.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. We will start with the frontend, which includes creating a beautiful user interface (UI) website. Subsequently, we will move on to the backend, where we will implement a private admin dashboard accessible only to authorized administrators. The admin dashboard will allow administrators to control the website's content and manage orders efficiently. To seamlessly integrate the frontend and backend and manage state, we will utilize Redux Toolkit.

## Frontend Development

### Step 1: Create Banner

- Design and create an eye-catching banner for the website's homepage.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a visually appealing banner.

### Step 2: Create Slider Images

- Implement an interactive image slider or carousel to showcase construction projects or featured content.
- Consider using libraries like "react-responsive-carousel" or crafting a custom solution.
